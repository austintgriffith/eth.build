[Hash Function](https://youtu.be/QJ010l-pBpE)
Think of it like a fingerprint of any given input data.
Input can be any size, output is always the same size (64 hex chars).
Deterministic, you will always get the same hash for a specific input.
One directional, given a hash it is impossible to guess the seed.

[Key Pair](https://youtu.be/9LtBDy67Tho)
Consists of a public key derived from a private key.
Your address where you send value is derived from your public key.
Can be used to sign a message and anyone can recover the signer's address.
Anyone can generate an Ethereum account by just generating a random private key.

[Look Ahead: Transactions](https://youtu.be/mhwSGYRmkEU)
Users can sign messages that go on-chain to send and receive value.
No decimals! Amounts are integers, in Wei. 1 ETH is 10^18 Wei.
You can generate accounts by just randomly generating private keys.

[Side Quest: Encryption](https://youtu.be/LGEBqz1uG1U)
Asymmetric encryption with Ethereum key pairs.
A small amount of data can be encrypted with a public key.
The private key is used to decrypt the data.
Not the best way to encrypt data!

[Distributed Ledger](https://youtu.be/z11wj9OcA4U)
Once we have key pairs and we can sign messages, our messages can be objects with to, from, value, etc.
A ledger keeps track of everyone's balance and new transactions are added to it.
Everyone keeps a copy of the same ledger.
Need a 'nonce' to prevent replay attacks.
Problems with network topology and consensus...

[Byzantine Generals](https://youtu.be/c7yvOlwBPoQ)
Coordination problem arises without a centralized authority.
Network (communication) is public and untrusted.
Generals prove their ability to wage war to other generals in messages.
Proof of work!

[Blockchain](https://youtu.be/zcX7OJ-L8XQ)
Proof of work is brute forcing a one-way hash function.
Miners with special hardware work to secure blocks of transactions.
Each block references the previous block to make a chain.
Longest chain wins and your weird uncle shows up to help with security.

[Transactions](https://youtu.be/er-0ihqFQB0)
Send value by signing an object with the details like 'to', 'value', 'data'.
'From' address is cryptographically recovered from the signature.
No decimals! Amounts are integers, in Wei. 1 ETH is 10^18 Wei.
Miners are incentivized with a fee to package transactions into blocks.
This fee is called the gas price and you 'bid' to get mined.

[Smart Contracts](https://youtu.be/-6aYBdnJ-nM)
Send 'machine code' as data in a transaction without a 'to' address.
Deployed code has an address just like an "externally owned account" with a private key.
Reading data is cheap and can come from any node on the network.
Storage and execution are relatively expensive. All nodes have to run and store everything.
Call a function on a contract by sending it a transaction with the function args in the data.
